Hi Fellow Programmers!

TheHumbleProgrammer here, to tell you a bit about myself. I have loved programming ever since I discovered computers didn't automatically know how to show us what we are looking at. I remember feeling duped like santa clause all over again. I then set out on my amazing journey to learn about the anatomy and inner workings of computers. Since that point, roughly 2 years ago, I have learned several programming languages and even found my niche! Or the beginnings of one at least. I discovered Java and then Kotlin (after diving into Python and JavaScript first of course) and the android studio IDE. I absolutely love the idea that at any point in my day or life, I could be able to pull out my laptop and create my own useful apps to use on my phone for what ever I may need. Of course this thought is what drove me to learn Kotlin and the Android SDK, but little did I know how disruptingly difficult it was going to be. I had not realized how much complexity has been abstracted away from software development over the years and to really understand what you are doing at a later stage, an understanding of the finer details and concepts of computer science is crucial. So this marks the beginning of my documented journey to becoming a skilled Android App Developer.

Nice to meet you all!
